A PiX session is not a line — it is a graph that keeps growing: every conversation turn is a node, and any node can sprout a new branch at any time.

## Non-linear sessions

A traditional AI chat is a single timeline: to change direction you either start over or keep piling questions onto the same thread until the context becomes a mess.

PiX organizes a session as a graph that grows left to right:

- Every turn (your prompt plus the assistant's reply and tool calls) is a node on the graph.
- Several directions can live on the same graph — switch to another branch at any time and keep going, without interference.
- When a path works out, keep going deeper; dead ends stay on the graph, and you can always come back and try another route.
- Sessions are real Pi sessions — no new format — so they remain usable outside PiX.

## Branch anytime

Branching is an everyday action in PiX, not something you have to plan ahead:

- **Fork from any user message**: unhappy with an answer? Fork a new branch from that turn with a different prompt or approach — the original branch stays untouched.
- **Continue from a turn**: select any earlier node on the graph and pick up the conversation from that moment.
- **Clone the active branch**: clone the current branch as a save point and experiment freely. Every branch stays visible on the graph, ready to switch back to at any time.

## Context follows the branch

Switching branches never means re-setting up context — context is part of the branch:

- The **branch chat panel** shows only the messages of the active branch. Switch to another branch and the chat switches with it.
- A single click highlights a node on the graph without touching any panel (graph commands such as /fork act on the highlighted node); a double-click aligns the primary chat panel to that node.
- Double-click a node on the graph to open its conversation in the primary chat panel. Ctrl+double-click (or the right-click menu's "Open in chat panel") pins that branch to a second or third side-by-side chat column — up to 3 columns at once for comparing branches. Each branch keeps a single panel: opening another node of an already-pinned branch retargets that column. Every column scrolls and replies independently. Replying from a pinned column grows that branch in place: the column follows the newly created node, and the primary column keeps the current selection. Closing the last pinned column — or the next start — restores the chat width.
- The **branch context panel** follows the selected node and shows how that turn went: thinking, tool calls, duration, and step count — and you can reply to the selected node right from there.

## Remote Node runtime

SSH and WSL share one installer. A working selected Node stays in use; fresh installations prefer Linux Node from PATH or the interactive login environment (such as nvm), with a minimum version of 22.19.0. Dependencies, server startup, WebSocket connectivity and a real terminal must pass checks before the current installation changes.

Only when no compatible runtime is available does PiX use its fixed-version private Node, independent of the desktop's Node patch version. Launches use a fixed executable path and recheck changed Node versions; reconnecting can repair a missing or incompatible runtime. System Node, older installations and shared runtimes are not modified or automatically removed.

Developer checks: `node --test test/remote-runtime.test.mjs` (Windows defaults to Ubuntu-24.04; override with `PIX_TEST_WSL_DISTRO`). After building the server, run `node test/runtime-live-test.mjs --ssh HOST` or `--wsl DISTRO` to verify real Node reuse in an isolated temporary directory without switching the main installation.

## Download

PiX includes `@injaneity/pi-computer-use` and `@ff-labs/pi-fff`, loaded through Pi's extension mechanism. Both carry native binaries, so they and their runtime dependencies ship with the app — no separate install is needed, and an npm copy you installed through Pi takes precedence. `pi-web-access` no longer ships with the installer: install it with one click on the Settings → Extensions page and keep it current with `pi update`. Web search services still use your own configuration and credentials.

Grab the installer for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/huang-sh/PiX/releases):

- **Windows**: `PiX-Setup-x.y.z.exe` (installer) or `PiX-Portable-x.y.z.exe` (portable), x64.
- **macOS**: `PiX-x.y.z-arm64.dmg` or `PiX-x.y.z-x64.dmg`, zip archives also available.

Installers are unsigned: if Windows SmartScreen warns, choose "Run anyway"; on macOS, allow the app in System Settings → Privacy & Security on first launch.

<details>
<summary>Run from source</summary>

Requires Node.js 22.19 or newer.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run verify` runs the full typecheck, test, and startup smoke suite.

`npm run test:fff` checks bundled file search; `npm run test:web` checks the web extension's installed layout (a real npm install, needs network) and page fetching, both with isolated settings. On macOS, `npm run dist:mac` packages the current machine's architecture; CI builds on separate Apple Silicon and Intel runners to include the matching native libraries.
